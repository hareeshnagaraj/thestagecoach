		<div>"Our house was comprehensively staged, outside and in. We followed every 
		detailed recommendation. Implementing Penny and Jennifer's ideas ensured our house and yard looked flawless. A week before our house went on the market, a house with the same floor plan, and a pool and larger backyard, went up for sale right across the street. We decided to enter the market at the same price. The staging paid off: our first day on the market we had competing contracts. Our house sold 22 days faster, and for $60,000 more than the house across the street. Thank goodness we had The Stage Coach, LLC on our side."</div>

		<div style="">"The Stage Coach, LLC helped stage our house in McLean, VA for sale last April, 2013. They were terrific. They came to our house on very short notice with enthusiasm, equipment and smarts. In just a few hours our house was transformed. They cleared clutter, moved furniture and rearranged artwork and mirrors on the walls. We were amazed by the amount of work Jennifer and Penny were able to get done in such a short time, and how effective their focus proved to be. We would not have been ready for our open house without them. Our house sold for the asking price in one week."</div>

		<div style="margin-top:5px;">"After spending years bemoaning the state of the main living area in my home I recently contacted Jennifer Downs and Penny Shelby of the Stage Coach, LLC, to help me redesign the space in order to make it more functional, livable, and aesthetically pleasing. 
		<br><br>Without purchasing a single item and using only furnishings and objects that were already in my house, Jennifer and Penny completely redesigned and rearranged my living room/dining room area creating a beautiful, functional and tasteful space which has transformed my home. Pictures were moved and re-hung, rugs and furnishings were switched around and everything was completely finished and ready to go. All of this was done from start to finish in one day. My one regret is that I did not contact her years ago. We are absolutely thrilled with the result of this project.
		<br><br>Two days after this transformation occurred I held a large party in my home. Without exception, every guest who had previously visited my house expressed their astonishment and amazement at the transformation. I would not hesitate to highly recommend Jennifer and Penny's design/staging services. In addition to their great eye, innate good taste and design credentials they are a pleasure to work with. In fact, I plan to contact them again shortly to help with paint color selections and the reworking of other rooms in my house."</div>
