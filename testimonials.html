		<div>"Our house was comprehensively staged, outside and in. We followed every 
		detailed recommendation. Implementing Penny and Jennifer's ideas ensured our house and yard looked flawless. A week before our house went on the market, a house with the same floor plan, and a pool and larger backyard, went up for sale right across the street. We decided to enter the market at the same price. The staging paid off: our first day on the market we had competing contracts. Our house sold 22 days faster, and for $60,000 more than the house across the street. Thank goodness we had The Stage Coach, LLC on our side."</div>

They came to our house on very short notice with enthusiasm, equipment and smarts. In just a few hours our house was transformed. They cleared clutter, moved furniture and rearranged artwork and mirrors on the walls. We were amazed by the amount of work Jennifer and Penny were able to get done in such a short time, and how effective their focus proved to be. We would not have been ready for our open house without them. Our house sold for the asking price in one week."</div>
